readme for Data Project

Group: Janina and Nadja

The project investigates China's FDI outflows to African countries during
the period 2003-2017 using data available online from http://www.sais-cari.org.
The data is scraped from this website, cleaned and structured as a panel data set.

We present summary statistics both in text and in figures (using matplotlib) in order
to provide a descriptive analysis of FDI flows from China to Africa.
